Finite element method (FEM) derivation using symbolic math

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the mathematical derivations involved in FEM theory using the symbolic math functionality provided by Maxima. It is expected that:

1. Understanding of abstract and complex FEM theory can be made easier via interaction with both the code and formulas.
2. General Maxima functions are to be implemented for the automatic derivation of shape functions, Jacobin matrices, numerical quadrature rules, etc. of any order and on typical types of mesh cells.
